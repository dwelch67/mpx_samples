
Below are a modified version of the mpx instructions written by the
mpx author.  I have modified the script to only build binutils and gcc,
I didnt have a use for the other items.  You might.  Grab the build_gcc.zip
file from the opencores project page to get the complete script and
build everything if you want/need it.

I have also attempted, perhaps successfully, dont know, to take the
mods to gcc 4.6.1 and apply them to 4.7.0.  It built gcc for me and
that gcc built the examples, but I dont use divide so maybe I didnt
expose the changes other than the command line options.

Instructions
------------

Choose a destination directory, for example /usr/local/mips-elf

sudo mkdir /usr/local/mips-elf
sudo ./build_gcc /usr/local/mips-elf


Details
-------
The script will fetch binutil 2.21.1 & GCC 4.7.0 from the web, then apply the GCC patches.
The build will result in GCC executables for mips-elf which support the following new flags:

- mnohwmult          - Disable mult/multu instructions (use software multiplication instead).
- mnohwdiv           - Disable div/divu instructions (use software division instead).
- mpatfree           - Disable use of formally patented lwl/lwr/swl/swr instructions (unaligned access instructions).
