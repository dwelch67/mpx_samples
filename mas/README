This is still very new, and barely debugged.

This is a standalone mips assembler (mas), intentionally targeted to the
instruction set supported by the mpx processor found at opencores.

This is intended to be portable enough to compile almost anywhere without
a pile of libraries (the C compiler and C library is all you need).  So
if you want to just try mips assembly language and for whatever reason
cannot or wont get and build binutils.  Or just want a simple, no frills
assembler, mas should work for you.

TODO, mips assembly language tutorials.
